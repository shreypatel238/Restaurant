# Restaurant
Restaurant catalog software

## To Run
1. First we need to clone the repository to your local computer by `git clone https://github.com/shreypatel238/Restaurant.git` from your terminal in your desired location
   - If it's easier, you also go on the green code tab and download as a zip file, and unzip the file in your desired location
2. It is best to use IntelliJ, so open up IntelliJ, click on open project, then selected the folder where you clone/unzip the repository
   - If not using IntelliJ and using another editor, open the project folder
4. Once IntelliJ is loaded up, select the `HomePage.java` file, then press the green play button on the top right corner. The application will start running.
   - If not using IntelliJ, you can use the terminal. To compile, point the terminal to `src` directory and run `javac HomePage.java` then you can run the application by `java HomePage`

## Workflow
1. `git pull` always before working
2. `git add --all` then `git commit -m <MessageHere>` then `git push -u origin main` after working
   - If it's eaiser, you can also directly update and add file here
